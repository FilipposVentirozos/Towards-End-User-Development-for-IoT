our DET O

well ADV O

the DET O
heating NOUN O

the DET O
plastic NOUN O
caused VERB O
it PRON O

so ADV O
please INTJ O
take VERB O
my DET O
advice NOUN O

use VERB O
silicone NOUN O

if ADP O
you PRON O

specifically ADV O
use VERB O

something NOUN O

you PRON O

this DET O

it PRON O

your DET O
