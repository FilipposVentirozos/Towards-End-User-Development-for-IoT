note NOUN O

the DET O
reason NOUN O
we PRON O
suggest VERB O

silicone NOUN O

is VERB O
that DET O
chemically ADV O
it PRON O

safer ADJ O

plastic NOUN O

can VERB O
take VERB O
higher ADJ O

extremely ADV O

our DET O
first ADJ O
try NOUN O

suggested VERB O
by ADP O
other ADJ O

did VERB O

turn VERB O

so ADV O
well ADV O
. PUNCT O
the DET O
heating NOUN O

cooling NOUN O
of ADP O
the DET O
plastic NOUN O
caused VERB O
it PRON O

turn VERB O
brittle ADJ O

made VERB O

harder ADJ O
to PART O
take VERB O
the DET O

whacked VERB O

the DET O

so ADV O
please INTJ O
take VERB O
my DET O
advice NOUN O
and CCONJ O
use VERB O
silicone NOUN O
baking NOUN O

if ADP O
you PRON O
have VERB O
them PRON O
on ADP O

specifically ADV O
use VERB O
silicone NOUN O

you PRON O

the DET O

you PRON O

now ADV O
here ADV O

something NOUN O

do VERB O
while ADP O
you PRON O
wait VERB O

the DET O
syrup NOUN O

you PRON O
can VERB O
also ADV O
do VERB O
this DET O
while ADP O
the DET O

is VERB O
boiling VERB O

working VERB O
it PRON O

the DET O
desired VERB O

do VERB O
this DET O
at ADP O
the DET O
very ADJ O

put VERB O

about ADV O
10 NUM O

then ADV O
put VERB O

not ADV O
turn VERB O

your DET O
